# Mobile Services Overview

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-concepts](../includes/mobile-services-concepts.md)]

## Mobile Services or Azure App Service?

In addition to a Mobile Services backend for your app, the Azure App Service platform also supports mobile device development with its Mobile Apps offering. While intending to provide parity with the key feature of Mobile Services, Mobile Apps leverages App Service to provide some additional features not available in Mobile Services. The App Service platform is currently in preview. For more information, see the article [Mobile Services vs. App Service](app-service-mobile-value-prop-migration-from-mobile-services-preview.md).
